# Schema Store APIs

Schema is the structure representing classes in your app. You can use the schema of an app to verify operations in a unit test, generate test data, generate test classes and then clean up after tests. The Schema Store APIs can also be used to create custom views of your data.

This API allows you to access the schemas of your app. Note: This API can be only accessed using the `X-Storage-Master-Key`.
